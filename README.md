# Energy-Bacha-Hackathon-Project
An app that helps users save energy by adopting best practices and also rewards them based on how much they save.

****PROBLEM STATEMENT****
It is estimated that around 35% of the energy supplied to the households is wasted. The typical sources for wastage include:
▪ Inefficient insulation for cooling or heating 
▪ Faulty gadgets or appliances
▪ Not using energy efficient models of appliances like refrigerators, AC
▪ Vampire appliances or electronics (consume power even when switched off or in standby mode) 
▪ Use of incandescent or spot lights While many households might not even be aware of this wastage, but at the global level, 
this wastage adds up to a significant percentage of the energy generated. Industries and big buildings conduct regular energy audits to identify and 
fix energy inefficiencies and wastage. It is imperative that such measures are also made available for the households. 
Current methods of auditing will not be feasible for households as energy auditors are few in numbers and their charges are quite high. Especially in developing countries 
where sufficient energy is not generated, it is quintessential that the energy already generate is not wasted. Hence there is a need for an inexpensive or free solution that 
could be used by typical households to identify areas of energy wastage and measures to stop those.[ Hint : coding using IoT ]

*******Solution**********

An IoT based app, EnergyBacha , will provide users with their energy consumption data and a platform to connect them to consultants for improving their energy usage.
Users of this app will get a complete analysis of their energy consumption data trough which they can know where abnormal amounts of electricity is being wasted.
Then, users can choose to upload that data on their public profiles, where consultants can offer their service.
A consultation meeting can be booked by the users and they can follow the tips and advice to improve upon their energy requirements.
If a reduction in energy consumption or wasted energy is identified by the app, then the users will be rewarded with ERC 20 standard Tokens made from Ethereum blockchain.
And on the website, a blockchain based bill payment service is provided to avoid frauds.
